    "desc": "We use Swift Transport for a few different outcomes, relocate equipment between Sydney and the Central Coast and an Hourly Work as Directed Service. We simply make a call and the next day a driver in a fully equipped ute arrives ready for work. When we need to send items to Sydney that are planned, it works out far better to use Swift than use our own vehicles. The vehicles are well presented, well fitted and the drivers are all very helpful, and the rate is always excellent."
